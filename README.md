# Hash Table Data Structure Project 

In this project, I created a hash table data structurre to work for any data type. 

Google Tests were used to test the code. 

Source code for this project was provided. 

## Hash Table Functions: 
Functions include Hash Table insert, delete, find, update. 
The table also makes use of a Hash Table iterator to iterate through the table. 


### The files I completed on my own are: 
-HashTable.c and Vector.c
-Makefile
-TestHash.cpp and TestVector.cpp

To handle collisions, Cuckoo Hashing was used.
